# Tiny Web Projects

> This repository contains small projects I do when bored or just feeling like coding.<br>
> These projects are mostly some JavaScript effects, CSS animations, and components.<br>
> I will try my best to keep this pure HTML, CSS, and JS only. No frameworks or libraries.

README is going to be updated as I have more projects in this repository.

Also, I want to create a page where you have links and previews of all the projects and publish all of these to GitHub Pages one day.
